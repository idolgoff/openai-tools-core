# System Design Document

## Architecture Overview

The OpenAI Tools Playground is designed with a modular architecture to facilitate testing of OpenAI tools through a Telegram bot interface. The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Telegram Bot Interface**: Handles user interactions via Telegram
2. **NLP Processing Layer**: Interprets natural language commands
3. **Tools Manager**: Manages the collection of mocked AI tools
4. **Logging System**: Records tool selection and execution
5. **Environment Configuration**: Manages application settings

## Component Details

### Telegram Bot Interface

- Utilizes the python-telegram-bot library
- Implements handlers for different types of messages and commands
- Maintains conversation context for multi-step interactions
- Formats responses in a user-friendly manner

### NLP Processing Layer

- Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
- Extracts intents and entities from user messages
- Maps natural language requests to specific tool functions
- Generates natural language responses based on tool outputs

### Tools Manager

- Provides a unified interface for all mocked AI tools
- Implements project management functionality:
  - List projects: Returns a formatted list of available projects
  - Delete project: Removes a project by ID
  - Switch project: Changes the active project context
- Allows for easy addition of new tools

### Logging System

- Console logging for development and debugging
- Structured logging format for easy parsing
- Different log levels for various types of events
- Detailed logging of tool selection and execution

### Environment Configuration

- Loads configuration from .env file
- Provides sensible defaults for missing values
- Validates required configuration parameters
- Exposes configuration through a clean API

## Data Flow

1. User sends a message to the Telegram bot
2. Bot forwards the message to the NLP processing layer
3. NLP layer interprets the message and identifies the appropriate tool
4. Tools manager executes the selected tool
5. Result is logged and formatted as a natural language response
6. Response is sent back to the user via Telegram

## Security Considerations

- Telegram bot token stored securely in .env file
- OpenAI API key managed through environment variables
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
